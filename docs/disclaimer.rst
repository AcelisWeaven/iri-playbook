* This tutorial is based on the repository's Ansible-playbook I provided. It has been tested on CentOS 7.4 and Ubuntu 16.04.
* This tutorial does not include information on how to harden security on your server.
* For some details I will leave it to you to google (for example, how to SSH access your server). Otherwise the tutorial becomes too lofty.
* I recommend that you use SSH key authentication to your server, disable root SSH access and disable password authentication. In addition, do not expose firew
all ports if not necessary.
* I am not associated with the IOTA foundation. I am simply an enthusiastic community member.
