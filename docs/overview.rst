Overview
********

This tutorial will help you setup a full node on a Linux system (Ubuntu or CentOS).
The git repository I have created includes an automated installation.

I hope to be adding other distributions like Debian in the future.

The automated installed installs IRI and IOTA peer manager, a web GUI with which you can view your neighbors, add or remove neighbors, view the sync etc.
In addition, it will install IOTA node monitoring/graphs (grafana).
